# SwiftUI-Intro
**SwiftUI** has been introduced in **2019** by Apple at their WWDC.<br>
SwiftUI makes you write better apps with less code as Apple states. Is it true?<br>
Prior to `SwiftUI`, we were using `UIKit`, an imperative framework introduced by Apple in 2014<br>
to build user interfaces. It is still available, but it is slowly being replaced, since Apple shifted<br>
the focus to SwiftUI.<br>
